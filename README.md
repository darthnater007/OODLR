# OodlrApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.  It is a simple animated web page that does some funny stuff with user generated strings using Angular and several Javascript libraries (Bootstrap, GreenSock, FontAwesome).

## What is OODLR?
OODLR takes a user input string and turns every vowel into an 'oodle,' because it is wildly funny.  For instance, let's take my name and Oodlerize it.  'Nate Perkins' becomes 'Noodletoodle Poodlerkoodlens.'

## Is This App Necessary, and Does it Solve a Problem, and Will it Save the World?

Nope.  Was bored on a Sunday and thought it might be worth a laugh.  
-Or perhaps I should say:  -
Noodlepoodle.  Woodles boodleroodled oodlen oodle Soodlendoodleoodle oodlend thoodleoodleght oodlet moodleght oodlet boodle woodlerth oodle loodleoodlegh.

# Want to Mess Around With the Code?
Clone it, pull it, steal it, write it from memory with a blindfold on; do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  Here's some info on how to run it once the project is on your machine.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
NOTE ABOUT GSAP W/ANGULAR:  GreenSock Animation Platform has known issues running 'ng build --prod.'  I found some fixes for this issue here:

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
NOTE:  You can run this command if you want.  I haven't written any tests though.
